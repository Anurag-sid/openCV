# openCV
This Repo demonstrates image processing, data augmentation, and object detection using deep learning techniques. We processed an image using OpenCV for tasks like resizing and annotation, then applied data augmentation with Keras, and finally implemented YOLOv5 for real-time object detection, ensuring proper setup of the environment and file paths.
